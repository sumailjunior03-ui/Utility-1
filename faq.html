                <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>

                <h3>What counts as a business day?</h3>
                <p>
                    A business day is Monday through Friday, excluding US
                    federal holidays (observed). Weekends are never counted.
                </p>

                <h3>Are US federal holidays included?</h3>
                <p>
                    Yes. All observed US federal holidays are automatically
                    excluded from business day counts, including New Year's Day,
                    MLK Day, Presidents Day, Memorial Day, Juneteenth,
                    Independence Day, Labor Day, Columbus Day, Veterans Day,
                    Thanksgiving, and Christmas.
                </p>

                <h3>What does "Include start date as Day 1" mean?</h3>
                <p>
                    If enabled, the start date itself counts as Day 1 — but only
                    if it is a business day. If the start date falls on a
                    weekend or holiday it is skipped and counting begins on the
                    next business day.
                </p>

                <h3>How does "Business days between dates" work?</h3>
                <p>
                    This mode counts how many business days fall between two
                    dates, excluding weekends and federal holidays. Useful for
                    calculating deadlines, payment windows, or contract terms.
                </p>

                <h3>Can I add custom holidays?</h3>
                <p>
                    Yes — paste any custom holiday dates (YYYY-MM-DD format, one
                    per line) in the custom holidays field and they will be
                    excluded from calculations automatically.
                </p>

                <h3>Do you store my data?</h3>
                <p>
                    No. All calculations run entirely in your browser. No data
                    is sent to any server or stored anywhere.
                </p>

                <h3>Is this tool free?</h3>
                <p>Yes, completely free with no account required.</p>
